Mission\nYou are the executor for this repository. Your goal is to run the full RoboTwin 2.0 pipeline end-to-end:\n**Data Collection → Data Processing → Training → Evaluation**, iterating until it works.\n\nDefault to using ACT for the policy choice, unless there are other relevant requirements.\n\nThis repo is research/engineering code. The instructions and examples may be incomplete or wrong.\nWhen you hit errors, **explore and debug autonomously**. Prefer an incremental approach:\nstart from minimal smoke tests, then scale up.\n\n---\n\n### 0.1 Documentation Entry Points (Read first / consult as needed)\nTo keep this file short, extended guidance and navigation are split into `docs/`:\n\n- **Execution Playbook**: `docs/codex_playbook.md`  \n  Includes: RUNID/record templates, nohup guidance, debugging order, and common self-check commands.\n\n- **Pipeline Map**: `docs/robowin_pipeline_map.md`  \n  Includes: entry-point hints for each pipeline stage (collect/process/train/eval), pointers to key configs, artifact location guidelines, and a quick repo-search checklist (`rg/find`) to discover entry points.\n\n## 1. Non-negotiable Safety Rules (Hard Constraints)\n1) **No sudo**. Do not run `sudo` or any command requiring elevated privileges.\n\n2) **No destructive commands** (including equivalents). Examples (non-exhaustive):\n- `rm -rf` on broad paths (repo root, parent dirs, `~`, `/`, glob-heavy deletes)\n- `mkfs`, `dd`, `chmod -R`, `chown -R`, disk/partition tools\n- Overwriting unknown files with `> somefile` unless the file is newly created by you in this run\n\n3) **Do NOT modify any pre-existing file** (anything that existed before this run began).\n- Allowed: create new files/dirs; copy an existing file to a new file; edit the new file.\n- If you need to “change a call-site”, do it via a **new wrapper script/config** and use that wrapper for execution.\n\nHow to change behavior without editing existing files:\nDo not edit any pre-existing file. If you need to change a called script/config, first copy it to a new RUNID-suffixed file and modify the copy; then copy the upstream entry/caller and update it to reference the new file.\nExample: if the original flow is c.sh -> a.py, create b.py (copied from a.py and modified), then create d.sh (copied from c.sh and updated to call b.py). This satisfies “no changes to old files; only add new files.”\n\n4) **Stay inside repo root**.\n- Do not read/write outside this repository (no `/etc`, `~/.ssh`, system dirs, other repos).\n- Use web search only via your built-in search tool, and cache key findings to docs (see below).\n\n---\n\n## 2. RUN Protocol (Required)\nAt the start of each run, generate a RUNID:\n- Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (UTC+8)\n- Use RUNID in names of all new files you create, e.g. `*_RUNID.*` or `*__rRUNID.*`\n\nYou must produce two kinds of records:\n\n### 2.1 Worklog (required)\nCreate `worklog_<RUNID>.md` in repo root, and keep it updated.\nIt must include:\n- Objective & constraints (task, metrics, resources)\n- Commands executed (copy/paste exact commands)\n- Newly created files/dirs list (paths + purpose)\n- Logs & PIDs (if nohup)\n- Artifacts locations: dataset/processed_data/ckpt/eval outputs\n\n### 2.2 Web search cache (Recommended Practice)\nCreate at least one cache file under `docs/cache/`, for example:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>.md`\n\nIf the content is large, you may create multiple files, e.g.:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_01.md`\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_02.md`\n\nEach cache file should include:\n- Links + short notes\n- What problem it solved / which error message it relates to\n- Any concrete command/config snippet you applied\n\n---\n\n## 3. Execution for Long Runs (Recommended Practice)\nThis pipeline can take hours. Prefer robust execution:\n- Use `nohup` for long training/eval jobs.\n- Record the exact nohup command, log path, and PID to `worklog_<RUNID>.md`.\n- Periodically check progress via `tail -f <log>` or targeted `grep`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommended Self-Checks (Recommended Practice)\nYou should *often* sanity-check that you did not modify pre-existing files.\nRecommended commands:\n- `git status --porcelain`\n- `git diff --name-only`\n- `git diff` (ensure no edits to existing files)\n- `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (list newly added files)\n\nIf any existing file was modified, stop and fix by reverting, then proceed using new copies/wrappers.\n\n\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- plan: Generate a plan for how an agent should accomplish a complex coding task. Use when a user asks for a plan, and optionally when they want to save, find, read, update, or delete plan files in $CODEX_HOME/plans (default ~/.codex/plans). (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/plan/SKILL.md)\n- robotwin-act-perrun: Per run, create RUN_ID (Asia/Shanghai), generate 6 per-run ACT interface files (runner + 3 sh + task_config + eval python), then launch ACT pipeline via nohup with logs under full_pipeline/logs. (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex/skills/robotwin-act-perrun/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"uiui","git":{"commit_hash":"43605c747793090eb552f23ab0b5ed3684381e24","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:AnonAnonAnonAnonAnon/AML_draft_impl.git"}}}

Mission\nYou are the executor for this repository. Your goal is to run the full RoboTwin 2.0 pipeline end-to-end:\n**Data Collection → Data Processing → Training → Evaluation**, iterating until it works.\n\nDefault to using ACT for the policy choice, unless there are other relevant requirements.\n\nThis repo is research/engineering code. The instructions and examples may be incomplete or wrong.\nWhen you hit errors, **explore and debug autonomously**. Prefer an incremental approach:\nstart from minimal smoke tests, then scale up.\n\n---\n\n### 0.1 Documentation Entry Points (Read first / consult as needed)\nTo keep this file short, extended guidance and navigation are split into `docs/`:\n\n- **Execution Playbook**: `docs/codex_playbook.md`  \n  Includes: RUNID/record templates, nohup guidance, debugging order, and common self-check commands.\n\n- **Pipeline Map**: `docs/robowin_pipeline_map.md`  \n  Includes: entry-point hints for each pipeline stage (collect/process/train/eval), pointers to key configs, artifact location guidelines, and a quick repo-search checklist (`rg/find`) to discover entry points.\n\n## 1. Non-negotiable Safety Rules (Hard Constraints)\n1) **No sudo**. Do not run `sudo` or any command requiring elevated privileges.\n\n2) **No destructive commands** (including equivalents). Examples (non-exhaustive):\n- `rm -rf` on broad paths (repo root, parent dirs, `~`, `/`, glob-heavy deletes)\n- `mkfs`, `dd`, `chmod -R`, `chown -R`, disk/partition tools\n- Overwriting unknown files with `> somefile` unless the file is newly created by you in this run\n\n3) **Do NOT modify any pre-existing file** (anything that existed before this run began).\n- Allowed: create new files/dirs; copy an existing file to a new file; edit the new file.\n- If you need to “change a call-site”, do it via a **new wrapper script/config** and use that wrapper for execution.\n\nHow to change behavior without editing existing files:\nDo not edit any pre-existing file. If you need to change a called script/config, first copy it to a new RUNID-suffixed file and modify the copy; then copy the upstream entry/caller and update it to reference the new file.\nExample: if the original flow is c.sh -> a.py, create b.py (copied from a.py and modified), then create d.sh (copied from c.sh and updated to call b.py). This satisfies “no changes to old files; only add new files.”\n\n4) **Stay inside repo root**.\n- Do not read/write outside this repository (no `/etc`, `~/.ssh`, system dirs, other repos).\n- Use web search only via your built-in search tool, and cache key findings to docs (see below).\n\n---\n\n## 2. RUN Protocol (Required)\nAt the start of each run, generate a RUNID:\n- Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (UTC+8)\n- Use RUNID in names of all new files you create, e.g. `*_RUNID.*` or `*__rRUNID.*`\n\nYou must produce two kinds of records:\n\n### 2.1 Worklog (required)\nCreate `worklog_<RUNID>.md` in repo root, and keep it updated.\nIt must include:\n- Objective & constraints (task, metrics, resources)\n- Commands executed (copy/paste exact commands)\n- Newly created files/dirs list (paths + purpose)\n- Logs & PIDs (if nohup)\n- Artifacts locations: dataset/processed_data/ckpt/eval outputs\n\n### 2.2 Web search cache (Recommended Practice)\nCreate at least one cache file under `docs/cache/`, for example:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>.md`\n\nIf the content is large, you may create multiple files, e.g.:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_01.md`\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_02.md`\n\nEach cache file should include:\n- Links + short notes\n- What problem it solved / which error message it relates to\n- Any concrete command/config snippet you applied\n\n---\n\n## 3. Execution for Long Runs (Recommended Practice)\nThis pipeline can take hours. Prefer robust execution:\n- Use `nohup` for long training/eval jobs.\n- Record the exact nohup command, log path, and PID to `worklog_<RUNID>.md`.\n- Periodically check progress via `tail -f <log>` or targeted `grep`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommended Self-Checks (Recommended Practice)\nYou should *often* sanity-check that you did not modify pre-existing files.\nRecommended commands:\n- `git status --porcelain`\n- `git diff --name-only`\n- `git diff` (ensure no edits to existing files)\n- `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (list newly added files)\n\nIf any existing file was modified, stop and fix by reverting, then proceed using new copies/wrappers.\n\n\n"}}

Core Constraints (Summary)\n- No sudo.\n- No destructive commands.\n- Do not modify pre-existing files; use **copy → modify new file → redirect call**.\n- Stay inside repo root.\n- Use RUNID everywhere; keep `worklog_<RUNID>.md` updated.\n\nHow to change behavior without editing existing files:\nDo not edit any pre-existing file. If you need to change a called script/config, first copy it to a new RUNID-suffixed file and modify the copy; then copy the upstream entry/caller and update it to reference the new file.\nExample: if the original flow is c.sh -> a.py, create b.py (copied from a.py and modified), then create d.sh (copied from c.sh and updated to call b.py). This satisfies “no changes to old files; only add new files.”\n\n---\n\n## B. RUNID & Record Templates (Recommended Practice)\n\n### B1) Worklog template (copy into `worklog_<RUNID>.md`)\n## Run <RUNID>\n### Objective\n- Task:\n- Metrics:\n- Constraints:\n  (If not, fill in null)\n\n### Environment\n- Host:\n- GPU:\n- Conda env:\n- Key paths:\n\n### New files/dirs created\n- (path) — purpose\n\n### Commands executed\n- (command)\n- (command)\n\n### Logs & PIDs\n- (log path) — (pid) — what it is\n\n### Artifacts (Recommended Practice)\n- Raw data:\n- Processed data:\n- Checkpoints:\n- Eval outputs:\n\n### Notes / Issues (Recommended Practice, Brief description)\n- Error:\n- Fix:\n- Reference (see docs/cache/...):\n\n---\n\n### B2) Web refs template (copy into `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_NN.md`) (Recommended Practice, Brief description)\n## Web refs <RUNID>_<NN>\n### Topic / error\n- What I was solving:\n\n### Links\n- (link) — why it matters\n- (link) — why it matters\n\n### Key takeaways\n- Bullet points\n\n---\n\n## C. Change Strategy: “Copy in-place” (Recommended Practice)\nBecause pre-existing files cannot be edited, follow this pattern:\n\n1) Identify a config/script you want to change:\n- e.g., `task_config/<base>.yml`, `train.sh`, `eval_policy.py`\n\n2) Copy it **in the same directory** and add RUNID suffix:\n- `cp task_config/<base>.yml task_config/<base>__r<RUNID>.yml`\n\n3) Modify only the new file:\n- change episode_num / domain_randomization / seed / ckpt_dir, etc.\n\n4) Do the same for the superior file (the file that calls this file); at this point, the call in the superior file should point to the new file\n\nHow to change behavior without editing existing files:\nDo not edit any pre-existing file. If you need to change a called script/config, first copy it to a new RUNID-suffixed file and modify the copy; then copy the upstream entry/caller and update it to reference the new file.\nExample: if the original flow is c.sh -> a.py, create b.py (copied from a.py and modified), then create d.sh (copied from c.sh and updated to call b.py). This satisfies “no changes to old files; only add new files.”\n\n---\n\n## E. nohup Patterns (Examples) (Recommended Practice)\n### E1) nohup for training\nnohup bash train__r<RUNID>.sh > logs/train__r<RUNID>.log 2>&1 & echo $! > logs/train__r<RUNID>.pid\n\n### E2) monitor\ntail -f logs/train__r<RUNID>.log\ncat logs/train__r<RUNID>.pid\nps -fp $(cat logs/train__r<RUNID>.pid)\n\nRecord the command/log/pid in `worklog_<RUNID>.md`.\n\n---\n\n## F. Recommended Git Self-Checks (Non-blocking) (Recommended Practice)\n- `git status --porcelain`\n- `git diff --name-only`\n\nIf you accidentally modified an existing file:\n- revert it, then re-apply changes via Copy in-place.\n"}}

use the exact name of the `task_config` file you created (typically matching the config name).\n\n`gpu_id` defaults to `6`, but before each run it is recommended to check available GPUs with `nvidia-smi` to avoid CUDA out-of-memory errors.\n\nref: https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/collect-data.html\n\n---\n\n### Stage 2: Data Processing (Convert to policy format, e.g., ACT/DP)\n\nGoal: convert the collected data into a format that can be used to train a specific model.\n\nThis depends on the policy you plan to use, e.g., **ACT**.\n\nBy default, use **ACT** unless the user specifies otherwise.\n\nIf you decide to use this policy, first switch to the policy directory, for example:\n\n```bash\ncd policy/ACT\n```\n\nThen process the data.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nbash process_data.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${expert_data_num}\n```\n\n```bash\nbash process_data.sh beat_block_hammer demo_clean 50\n```\n\nIf you modify this script, you must copy it to a new file and run **your newly created script** instead of the original one (though this is rarely needed).\n\n`task_name` defaults to `beat_block_hammer`, but it should be selected based on user requirements when provided.\n\n`task_config` defaults to `demo_clean`, but in practice it usually carries a RUNID suffix; use the exact name of the `task_config` file you created (typically matching the config name).\n\nRef: [https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html)\n\n---\n\n### Stage 3: Training\n\nGoal: start the training process.\n\nThis is the next step after data processing and should follow the decisions and settings made in the previous stages.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nbash train.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${expert_data_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}\n```\n\n```bash\nbash train.sh beat_block_hammer demo_clean 50 0 0\n```\n\n* `task_config` defaults to `demo_clean`, but in practice it usually carries a RUNID suffix; use the exact name of the `task_config` file you created (typically matching the config name).\n* `expert_data_num` defaults to `50`, unless the user requests otherwise and you have already adjusted the relevant configs earlier.\n* `seed` defaults to `0`.\n* `gpu_id` defaults to `6`, but before each run it is recommended to check available GPUs with `nvidia-smi` to avoid CUDA out-of-memory errors.\n\nRef: [https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html)\n\n---\n\n### Stage 4: Evaluation / Inference\n\nGoal: evaluate the model trained in the previous steps.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nbash eval.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${ckpt_setting} ${expert_data_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}\n```\n\n```bash\n# bash eval.sh beat_block_hammer demo_clean demo_clean 50 0 0\n# This command trains the policy using the `demo_clean` setting ($ckpt_setting)\n# and evaluates it using the same `demo_clean` setting ($task_config).\n```\n\nMake sure that `task_config`, `ckpt_setting`, and other related settings stay consistent with the earlier stages of the pipeline.\n\n* `task_config` defaults to `demo_clean`, but in practice it usually carries a RUNID suffix; use the exact name of the `task_config` file you created (typically matching the config name).\n\n* `gpu_id` defaults to `6`, but before each run it is recommended to check available GPUs with `nvidia-smi` to avoid CUDA out-of-memory errors.\n\nRef: [https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html)\n\n\n---\n\n## 2) Task Config (Common Starting Point)\n\nBefore running the four stages above, you first need to modify some configuration files or code according to user requirements. The modifications are implemented by copying new files, as mentioned earlier.\n\nModifications usually start with the task_config file.\n\nExample: you can read it yourself:\n\n* `task_config/demo_clean.yml`\n\nThe task config controls basic task settings such as `domain_randomization`. You can open and inspect it.\n\nIn practice, you typically copy an existing task config (e.g., `task_config/demo_clean.yml`), then modify the copy according to the needs of the current run. The filename often includes an identifier; I recommend adding a RUNID suffix.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Modify Other Files as Needed\n\nThere may be other files that need to be adjusted based on user requirements.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, any modification must be done by **copying to a new file** and editing the copy.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Training configuration: `policy/ACT/train.sh`\n- Evaluation configuration: `policy/ACT/eval.sh`\n- Evaluation script: `script/eval_policy.py`\n\nThese are possible candidates, but not necessarily limited to them.\n\nYou are encouraged to explore the project and the documentation, and decide what to change based on runtime feedback and errors.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Artifact “Pointers” (What you must record)\nFor each successful run, ensure the worklog includes:\n- raw data directory\n- processed dataset directory\n- checkpoint directory\n- evaluation output (metrics log, csv, videos)\n"}}

It seems there’s confusion about the directory structure, specifically regarding `assets/embodiments`.
