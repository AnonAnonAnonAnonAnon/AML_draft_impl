Mission\nYou are the executor for this repository. Your goal is to run the full RoboTwin 2.0 pipeline end-to-end:\n**Data Collection → Data Processing → Training → Evaluation**, iterating until it works.\n\nDefault to using ACT for the policy choice, unless there are other relevant requirements.\n\nThis repo is research/engineering code. The instructions and examples may be incomplete or wrong.\nWhen you hit errors, **explore and debug autonomously**. Prefer an incremental approach:\nstart from minimal smoke tests, then scale up.\n\n---\n\n### 0.1 Documentation Entry Points (Read first / consult as needed)\nTo keep this file short, extended guidance and navigation are split into `docs/`:\n\n- **Execution Playbook**: `docs/codex_playbook.md`  \n  Includes: RUNID/record templates, nohup guidance, debugging order, and common self-check commands.\n\n- **Pipeline Map**: `docs/robowin_pipeline_map.md`  \n  Includes: entry-point hints for each pipeline stage (collect/process/train/eval), pointers to key configs, artifact location guidelines, and a quick repo-search checklist (`rg/find`) to discover entry points.\n\n## 1. Non-negotiable Safety Rules (Hard Constraints)\n1) **No sudo**. Do not run `sudo` or any command requiring elevated privileges.\n\n2) **No destructive commands** (including equivalents). Examples (non-exhaustive):\n- `rm -rf` on broad paths (repo root, parent dirs, `~`, `/`, glob-heavy deletes)\n- `mkfs`, `dd`, `chmod -R`, `chown -R`, disk/partition tools\n- Overwriting unknown files with `> somefile` unless the file is newly created by you in this run\n\n3) **Do NOT modify any pre-existing file** (anything that existed before this run began).\n- Allowed: create new files/dirs; copy an existing file to a new file; edit the new file.\n- If you need to “change a call-site”, do it via a **new wrapper script/config** and use that wrapper for execution.\n\nHow to change behavior without editing existing files:\nDo not edit any pre-existing file. If you need to change a called script/config, first copy it to a new RUNID-suffixed file and modify the copy; then copy the upstream entry/caller and update it to reference the new file.\nExample: if the original flow is c.sh -> a.py, create b.py (copied from a.py and modified), then create d.sh (copied from c.sh and updated to call b.py). This satisfies “no changes to old files; only add new files.”\n\n4) **Stay inside repo root**.\n- Do not read/write outside this repository (no `/etc`, `~/.ssh`, system dirs, other repos).\n- Use web search only via your built-in search tool, and cache key findings to docs (see below).\n\n---\n\n## 2. RUN Protocol (Recommended Approach)\nAt the start of each run, generate a RUNID:\n- Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (UTC+8)\n- Use RUNID in names of all new files you create, e.g. `*_RUNID.*` or `*__rRUNID.*`\n\nYou must produce two kinds of records:\n\n### 2.1 Worklog (required)\nCreate `worklog_<RUNID>.md` in repo root, and keep it updated.\nIt must include:\n- Objective & constraints (task, metrics, resources)\n- Commands executed (copy/paste exact commands)\n- Newly created files/dirs list (paths + purpose)\n- Logs & PIDs (if nohup)\n- Artifacts locations: dataset/processed_data/ckpt/eval outputs\n\n### 2.2 Web search cache (Recommended Practice)\nCreate at least one cache file under `docs/cache/`, for example:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>.md`\n\nIf the content is large, you may create multiple files, e.g.:\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_01.md`\n- `docs/cache/web_refs_<RUNID>_02.md`\n\nEach cache file should include:\n- Links + short notes\n- What problem it solved / which error message it relates to\n- Any concrete command/config snippet you applied\n\n### 2.3 About Environment and Download\n\nPlease note that the environment has already been largely set up and can run the full RoboTwin 2.0 end-to-end pipeline for both ACT and DP.\n\nTherefore, in most cases, you likely do not need to re-download all environments and assets exactly as described in the RoboTwin 2.0 documentation.\n\nYou can try running with my existing environment first.\n\nThe current environment is the conda environment `aml`.\n\nTo activate it:\n\n```bash\nconda activate aml\n```\n\nGenerally speaking, before asking you to work, I will activate the environment first. You can proceed directly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 3. Execution for Long Runs (Recommended Practice)\nThis pipeline can take hours. Prefer robust execution:\n- Use `nohup` for long training/eval jobs.\n- Record the exact nohup command, log path, and PID to `worklog_<RUNID>.md`.\n- Periodically check progress via `tail -f <log>` or targeted `grep`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommended Self-Checks (Recommended Practice)\nYou should *often* sanity-check that you did not modify pre-existing files.\nRecommended commands:\n- `git status --porcelain`\n- `git diff --name-only`\n- `git diff` (ensure no edits to existing files)\n- `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (list newly added files)\n\nIf any existing file was modified, stop and fix by reverting, then proceed using new copies/wrappers.\n\n\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- plan: Generate a plan for how an agent should accomplish a complex coding task. Use when a user asks for a plan, and optionally when they want to save, find, read, update, or delete plan files in $CODEX_HOME/plans (default ~/.codex/plans). (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/plan/SKILL.md)\n- robotwin-act-perrun: Per run, create RUN_ID (Asia/Shanghai), generate 6 per-run ACT interface files (runner + 3 sh + task_config + eval python), then launch ACT pipeline via nohup with logs under full_pipeline/logs. (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex/skills/robotwin-act-perrun/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /mnt/data/chenyiteng_datas/AML/AML_draft_impl/.codex_uiui/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"uiui","git":{"commit_hash":"c2c45d6e145a75e7231a04743bf64261191a9fbd","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:AnonAnonAnonAnonAnon/AML_draft_impl.git"}}}
