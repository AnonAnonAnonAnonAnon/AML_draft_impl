**Running a directory listing**

I need to run a command in the root of the repository to list the files. I'll use the shell_command function and set the working directory accordingly. For this command, I’ll list the first five entries using `ls -1 | head -n 5`. There shouldn't be any safety issues with this approach since it's just a basic file listing. Let’s get that information!

I'm planning my next steps by realizing that the tool needs a command string rather than an array. I think using a string with `bash -lc '...'` could work! The wrapper indicates that the command is a shell script, so let's proceed with that format. I want to ensure it's executed properly, so I'm feeling pretty confident about this plan moving forward!
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'bash -lc "ls -1 | head -n 5"' in /home/sumita-mana/aml/AML_draft_impl succeeded in 20ms:
